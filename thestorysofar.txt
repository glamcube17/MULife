Thing for submit by tommorow or thursday at latest to rr->dean for indep study

sev ppl can build & save
runs remotely (server client)
gonna do stuff more variations of GoL like colors, etc

The Story So Far:
Multiple people can make changes that will be shared between all windows.
(Currently only on the same machine, but that's just because it's only hosted locally at the moment.)
It has two main components, a remote server which saves and propogates changes and a client running in the browser which displays the current state and sends changes to the server.
The simulation can be stepped through locally, although this does not change the state of other clients and will be reverted the next time the state is fetched from the server.
Currently it can be stepped through using the rules for Conway's Life or HighLife. More variations are planned,
such as ***arbitrarily specifiable survive/born rules*** (as well as a list of presets for interesting settings) and possibly multiple cell colors.
